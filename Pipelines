create a job, as laptop-config
piplines
sample hello world, replacce hello with build as it is build stage
echo 'building a new laptop ' 
sh 'mkdir build'
sh 'touch build/computer.txt'
sh ' echo "Mainboard">>build/computer.txt'
sh 'cat build/computer.txt'

post {  -> make sure this is in the same line as build
      always {
              cleanWs()
              }
      }

use -p if the file is already created, it makes the file or dir if not present and if present appens them.

use sh 'sleep 600' to put the job to sleep for 600 seconds
